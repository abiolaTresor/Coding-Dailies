# Coding-Dailies
I'm subscribed to a site allowing me to have one coding exercise each day. I'm uploading here my solution to thoses exercises. The exercises are provided in the aim to prepare for interviews for big tech companies such as facebook, google, uber etc... I'm opened to any of your suggestions of improvement of the solutions. 

This repo contains a directory codin-dailies. 
Inside that directory, you will find directories named in format daily_[company_name]
In each directory of that format, you'll find two files: exercise.txt representing a coding exercise and solution.ipynb representing my solution to that exercise
