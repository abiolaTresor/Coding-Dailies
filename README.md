# Coding-Dailies
I've subscribed to a coding site allowing me to have one coding exercise each day. I'm uploading here my solution to thoses exercises. The exercises are provided in the aim to prepare for job interviews for big tech companies such as facebook, google, uber etc... You may glance at the repo to train your self or, if needed, analyse the solutions I suggest. I'm opened to any suggestion of improvement of the solutions. 

This repo contains a directory called "codin-dailies". 
Inside that directory, you will find directories named in format "daily_[company_name]".
In each directory of that format, you'll find two files: "exercise.txt" representing a coding exercise and "solution.ipynb" representing my solution to that exercise.
